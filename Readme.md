# 10X Visium Spatial Transcriptomics Pipeline to Analyse miRNA Expression Patterns

**Abstract:**   
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate messenger RNA (mRNA) expression post-transcriptionally in mammals by non-slicing repression. When a miRNA forms the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) with an Argonaute (AGO) protein, it targets specific mRNAs 
which are known as its targets. Since their discovery in 1993 by Lee et al. in C. elegans, the functions of miRNAs have been widely debated, with various mechanisms proposed. Stark et al. found in Drosophila that certain miRNAs and their targets are not co-expressed but are instead found in separate cells, suggesting a regulatory decision at specific transition points. This project investigates whether miRNAs act as guardians of gene expression between neighbouring cell types by analysing the expression levels of their targets at these transition points.  
To explore this, we developed a pipeline to detect the effect of tissue-specific miRNAs in Spatial Transcriptomic (ST) datasets, where gene expression levels are mapped to tissue locations. Selected ST datasets were then analysed to find neighbouring cell types with high and low expression of miRNA targets, indicating potential miRNA activity. By visualising the spatial expression patterns of the targets at these transition points using ST analysis tools, evidence can be collected to support the hypothesis. miR-124 and miR-1, specifically expressed in Brain and Heart tissue respectively, were detected with high confidence and with neighbouring clusters of high and low expression obtained for both. However, the hypothesis could not be validated in the brain dataset that was analysed in detail, as the expression of the targets was low only in one region and expressed to a higher level in varying degrees for all other cellular regions. The results however were promising as an initial step and should be followed up on by testing more datasets.

## Key Features

- **End-to-end spatial analysis pipeline:** Process raw 10x Visium data (gene-barcode matrices and tissue images) into analysis-ready form using Seurat and SPATA2 frameworks.  
- **Denoising with autoencoders:** Improve data quality by applying an autoencoder neural network to remove technical noise and outliers from the gene expression matrix.  
- **Flexible clustering methods:** Identify spatial domains using both conventional K-means clustering and spatially aware clustering with BayesSpace, to capture cell-type clusters and tissue regions.  
- **miRNA target integration:** Incorporate TargetScan predicted miRNA‚ÄìmRNA interactions to examine if differential gene expression at cluster boundaries could be explained by miRNA regulation.  
- **Spatial expression visualizations:** Generate heatmaps and spatial plots overlaying gene expression or cluster information on the tissue image, highlighting patterns (e.g. cluster-specific marker expression, cluster vs. cluster comparisons).  
- **Interactive Shiny app:** Includes a Shiny web application for interactive analysis ‚Äì allowing users to select clusters or genes, visualize spatial expression maps, and explore miRNA target effects in the tissue context.  

## How It Works

1. **Data Input & Setup:** The pipeline starts by loading a spatial transcriptomics dataset (10x Visium output, including the count matrix and spatial coordinates/image) and initializing it as a SPATA2/Seurat object. Basic preprocessing like quality control and normalization (using Seurat's SCTransform v2) is applied to prepare the data for analysis.  
2. **Denoising with Autoencoders:** An autoencoder neural network is then trained on the expression data to learn a compressed representation. The network's output is used to reconstruct a denoised expression matrix, reducing technical noise and emphasizing true biological signal.  
3. **Clustering (K-means & BayesSpace):** The pipeline performs unsupervised clustering on the spatial spots in two ways: (a) **K-means clustering** on the gene expression features to group spots by transcriptional similarity, and (b) **BayesSpace clustering**, which leverages a Bayesian model and spatial information to group neighboring spots into the same cluster. These approaches help identify distinct cell-type regions or spatial domains within the tissue.  
4. **miRNA Target Analysis:** For each identified cluster and boundary region, the pipeline analyzes gene expression differences and cross-references them with known miRNA target data. Using TargetScan predictions, it checks whether the genes up- or down-regulated at cluster edges are enriched for targets of certain miRNAs (especially tissue-specific miRNAs). This helps evaluate the hypothesis that those miRNAs might be regulating genes at the interface of different cell types.  
5. **Visualization & Outputs:** The results are compiled into easily interpretable outputs. The pipeline generates tables of cluster-specific marker genes and miRNA target overlaps, as well as **spatial heatmaps** that illustrate where particular gene expression or miRNA activity is high or low across the tissue slice. For example, it can produce a heatmap showing a cluster's top genes compared to all other clusters, or pairwise cluster comparison plots highlighting boundary effects. These visualizations are output as HTML reports and/or image files for further inspection.  
6. **Interactive Exploration:** Finally, the included Shiny app allows users to interactively explore the processed data. Users can load a processed SPATA2 object (as an `.rds` file), then dynamically generate plots and compare clusters via a web interface ‚Äì without needing to rerun code. This is especially useful for examining specific genes or miRNAs of interest in the spatial context, beyond the static results.
